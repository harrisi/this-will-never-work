# This Will Never Work

A bytecode-to-bytecode compiler for the masses that will never work.

# Current Goals

My current goal is to get some simple, compiled Java programs to run as compiled
Python programs. Ideally it will handle "Hello World"-like programs, but
handling the translation of standard library methods may be more difficult than
I hope. The simplest translation of a program that I can think of would be
simply returning a value, but some arithmetic would be ideal.
